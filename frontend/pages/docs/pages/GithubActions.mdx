# Github Actions CI/CD

> This section is WIP.

A collection of GitHub Actions and a K8s cluster may be used to manage the CI/CD process.

## Running workflows locally using `act`

1) Fill in `.secrets`.

Depending on the workflow, you may need to add `GITHUB_TOKEN` - scoped depending on your task objective - to the `.env` file.

2) `act workflow_dispatch --secret-file .env -W .github/workflows/<workflow>.yml`

In case you need to provide dispatch parameters, create an `event.json` file and use the `--eventpath` flag.
In most cases, just using `--input` should be sufficient.

For example, this will install the open-chat Helm chart to any Kubernetes cluster:

`.secrets`:

```bash
BOT_TOKEN="change me"
REGISTRY_HOST="change me"
REGISTRY_USER="change me"
REGISTRY_PASSWORD="change me"
DEPLOYMENT_VALUES_B64="change me"
INGRESS_HOST="change me"
```

> <Link href="/docs/example-values-helm-install">See here</Link> for an example `values.yaml` setup; use `base64 -w 0` to encode it.

```bash
act workflow_dispatch --input BUILD_TARGET=backend --secret-file .secrets -W .github/workflows/build-docker-image.yaml
act workflow_dispatch --input BUILD_TARGET=frontend --secret-file .secrets -W .github/workflows/build-docker-image.yaml
act workflow_dispatch --input DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=staging --input FRONTEND_IMAGE_URL="change me" --input BACKEND_IMAGE_URL="change me" --secret-file .secrets -W .github/workflows/install-helm.yaml
```

# Open Chat Repo CI/CD

This section discusses how the CI/CD process is managed for the open-chat repo and how it can be managed in a fork.

## Setting up environment

> As this is a public repo, it has access to [GitHub environments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment).
> If you are using this in the context of a private repo, you may need to adjust the GitHub Actions.

### Environment Secrets

You are required to configure the following:

- `KUBECONFIG_B64`: a base64 encoded kubeconfig file.
- `REGISTRY_PASSWORD`: a Docker registry password.
- `REGISTRY_HOST`: a Docker registry host.
- `REGISTRY_USER`: a Docker registry user.
- `DEPLOYMENT_VALUES_B64`: a base64 encoded Helm values file (can be deleted after installation).
- `BOT_TOKEN`: a scoped GitHub token of the bot account.
- `INGRESS_HOST`: the ingress host for the K8s cluster.

Since they are environment scoped, all workflows accessing this environment require prior approval from <Link href="https://github.com/tbscode" target="_blank">tbscode</Link> or another authorized maintainer.
