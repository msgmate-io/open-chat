# Github Actions CI/CD

> This section is WIP

A collection of github actions and a k8s cluster maybe be used to manage the CI/CD process.

## Running workflows locally using `act`

1) Fill `.secrets`

Depending on the workflow you might need to add `GITHUB_TOKEN` - scoped depending on your task objective - to the `.env` file.

2) `act workflow_dispatch --secret-file .env -W .github/workflows/<workflow>.yml`

Incase you require to provide dispatch params, create a `event.json` and use the `--eventpath` flag.
But most of the time just using `--input` should be sufficient.

e.g.: this will install the open-chat helm chart to any kubernetes cluster:

`.secrets`:

```bash
BOT_TOKEN="change me"
REGISTRY_HOST="change me"
REGISTRY_USER="change me"
REGISTRY_PASSWORD="change me"
DEPLOYMENT_VALUES_B64="change me"
INGRESS_HOST="change me"
```

> <Link href="/docs/example-values-helm-install">see here</Link> for an exmple `values.yaml` setup, use `base64 -w 0` to encode it.

```bash
act workflow_dispatch --input BUILD_TARGET=backend --secret-file .secrets -W .github/workflows/build-docker-image.yaml
act workflow_dispatch --input BUILD_TARGET=frontend --secret-file .secrets -W .github/workflows/build-docker-image.yaml
act workflow_dispatch --input DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=staging --input FRONTEND_IMAGE_URL="change me" --input BACKEND_IMAGE_URL="change me" --secret-file .secrets -W .github/workflows/install-helm.yaml
```

# Open Chat Repo CI/CD

Section discusses how the CI/CD process is managed for the open-chat repo / how it can be managed in a fork.

## Setting up environment

> As this is a public repo it has access to [github environments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment)
> If you are using this in context of a private repo you may need to adjust the github actions.

### Environment Secrets

You are required to configure the following:

- `KUBECONFIG_B64`: a base64 encoded kubeconfig file
- `REGISTRY_PASSWORD`: a docker registry password
- `REGISTRY_HOST`: a docker registry host
- `REGISTRY_USER`: a docker registry user
- `DEPLOYMENT_VALUES_B64`: a base64 encoded helm values file ( can be deleted after installation )
- `BOT_TOKEN`: a scoped github token of bot account
- `INGRESS_HOST`: the ingress host for the k8s cluster

Since they are environment scoped, all workflows accessing this enviroment require prior approval of <Link href="https://github.com/tbscode" target="_blank">tbscode</Link> or another autorized maintainer.
