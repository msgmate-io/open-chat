# Helm deployment

Backend & Frontend can be deployed seperately but a current image url for both must be provided.

## Locally using `microk8s`

Make sure you have [setup & installed](https://microk8s.io/docs/getting-started) `microk8s`.

> We utelize microk8s for easly local developement to work with managed k8s ( AKS or EKS ) you may need to add extra annotations to the ingress or add a loadbalancer.
> But for small scale deployment microk8s can also work [checkout tim's blog post on how this can be set-up](https://blog.t1m.me/blog/microk8s-on-vps)

### Build & Install Helm

1) Setup the env, `vim .env`

```bash
IMAGE_PREFIX="localhost:32000/open-chat-"
IMAGE_TAG="latest"
```

2) Build Backend & Frontend

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.pro.yaml build
```

3) Push to local micok8s registry

Setup and install microk8s on your system, then:

```bash
microk8s enable registry
docker compose -f docker-compose.pro.yaml push
```

4) Check default helm `values.yaml` ( should be good to go )

```bash
microk8s helm install -f ./helm/values.yaml open-chat ./helm
```

#### Deploying services individually

Currently `frontend` & `backend` services may be deployed seperately.

1) Build & Push only one service

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.pro.yaml <service-name> build
docker compose -f docker-compose.pro.yaml <service-name> push
```

2) Update OR retrieve the current helm `values.yaml`

Either edit `helm/values.yaml` to include you already deployed images.
Or retrieve the current image url's:

```bash
microk8s helm get values open-chat -o yaml > ./helm/values.yaml
```

3) Update the image url in `helm/values.yaml` and install the service

```bash
microk8s helm upgrade -f ./helm/values.yaml open-chat ./helm
```

### Uninstall Helm

```bash
microk8s helm uninstall open-chat
```
