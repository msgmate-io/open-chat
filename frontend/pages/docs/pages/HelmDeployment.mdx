# Helm Deployment

Backend & Frontend can be deployed separately, but a current image URL for both must be provided.

## Local Deployment using `microk8s`

Ensure that [setup & installation](https://microk8s.io/docs/getting-started) of `microk8s` has been done.

> Microk8s is utilized for easy local development. To work with managed k8s (AKS or EKS), you might need to add extra annotations to the ingress or add a load balancer.
> For small scale deployment, microk8s can also be efficient. [Check out Tim's blog post on how this can be set up](https://blog.t1m.me/blog/microk8s-on-vps)

### Build & Install Helm

1) Set up the environment, `vim .env`

```bash
IMAGE_PREFIX="localhost:32000/open-chat-"
IMAGE_TAG="latest"
```

2) Build Backend & Frontend

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.pro.yaml build
```

3) Push to the local microk8s registry

Setup and install microk8s on your system, then:

```bash
microk8s enable registry
docker compose -f docker-compose.pro.yaml push
```

4) Check default helm `values.yaml` (This should be fine)

```bash
microk8s helm upgrade --install -f ./helm/values.yaml open-chat ./helm
```

#### Service Deployment Individually

At present, `front-end` & `back-end` services can be deployed separately.

1) Build & Push only one service

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.pro.yaml <service-name> build
docker compose -f docker-compose.pro.yaml <service-name> push
```

2) Update or retrieve the current helm `values.yaml`

Either edit 'helm/values.yaml' to include already deployed images. Or retrieve the current image URLs:

```bash
microk8s helm get values open-chat -o yaml > ./helm/values.yaml
```

3) Update the image URL in 'helm/values.yaml' and install the service

```bash
microk8s helm upgrade -f ./helm/values.yaml open-chat ./helm
```

### Helm Uninstallation

```bash
microk8s helm uninstall open-chat
```
