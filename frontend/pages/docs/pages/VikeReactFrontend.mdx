# Vike React Frontend

The frontend is build with [`vike.dev`](https://vike.dev) in the web setting all static pages are fully serverside rendered.
Whilst for frontend clients we build all pages staticly.

We strive for good overall performance while maintaing a full static build and a complete redux store to allow providing offline fallback options.
